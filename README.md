## üéØ Project Overview

**AcquireFlow** is a comprehensive, full-stack Software as a Service (SaaS) application meticulously engineered to revolutionize the recruitment process for businesses and empower job seekers in their pursuit of career growth. This project serves as a hands-on, production-grade demonstration of building scalable and feature-rich web applications leveraging the complete Supabase ecosystem, drawing significant inspiration from the best practices outlined in "Building Production Grade Web Application with Supabase - David Lorenz."

My mission with AcquireFlow is to provide a seamless, efficient, and intelligent platform that bridges the gap between talent and opportunity, while simultaneously serving as a robust learning vehicle for advanced Supabase development.
